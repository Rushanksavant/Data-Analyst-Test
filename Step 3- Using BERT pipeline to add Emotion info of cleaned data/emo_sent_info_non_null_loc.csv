"Enjoyed our stay! Staff was welcoming and friendly. Chose this location for a weekend with my friends. When booking this room I requested a rollaway bed. When I called the front desk about the extra bed I requested, it was explained to me since we have two beds they could not accommodate us with a rollaway. Why give that an option during booking but not available during the stay? Overall it was a nice experience.

"Sent my parents on an anniversary trip, They wanted to stay local but wanted to get away from the heat in Riverside so they stayed here for two days. They said the property was secluded, clean and they felt safe in this area. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable and they had a nice view. The staff were friendly and found their reservation with no issues. ONLY downside is that they had to pay $20 per day for parking. The parking was private and they didn't worry about their car being broken into so that was a plus but it was an extra cost we didn't expect. Great location for site seeing.

"This property is advertised as being renovated. Only four floors are renovated and a renovation means basically new bedding. There were stains on the ceiling, a leaking shower, toilet that didn't work, peeling paint and an unpleasant manager when we asked to change our room. He seemed to think a non-working toilet wasn't an issue. I would not recommend nor ever stay in this property again. It was very disappointing.

Le navette non servono i parchi degli Universal Studios e non servono l�aeroporto quindi l�unico modo per spostarsi � il taxi peraltro abbastanza costoso.

"This place is a reasonable food dessert. Breakfast and lunch are $30 each and supper is $60. I noticed several parents waiting for pizza delivery. They charge for parking, so people are stuck there. The first night, I ate beef jerky and nuts from the gift shop. 
 There were stinky fruits all over the pool areas. They just tried to blow them under the bushes. STINKY!
 I needed my safe opened, and it took a long time to get them to do it. Most of the room was clean except mold in the shower. It rained a lot and there were NO inside activities. How about yoga or Zumba in the rainy season? I definitely Won't be back.

"This is a pleasant hotel, I was a little disappointed that I had to go to the restaurant and order take out for pool side dining. Not a bad thing but I did not expect that - I had to order the food, then go back 10 mins later. When I good a hotel with a pool and restaurant in the photos I do expect that little bit of service.
 They also charged $100 incidental charge. Was not expected it to be deducted and then have to wait 3 - 5 days for it to be returned to my account. Not cool!

"1st off - I knew right away I wouldn�t be staying at this property again. Right after check in, we go to self park, only to find out that we weren�t given a code for the gate. Go up to Valet, get the code, go get in our room. Mind you, self parking and our room were on COMPLETELY opposite sides of the hotel property. Next, I realize I was charged for parking and forgot to mention that we had a handicap tag. I call the front desk, explain, and get told that I would get a refund to the card I put on file. Sounds great, problem solved. Next day, hadn�t received any notification for the refund and ALSO got a notice on our car that it was going to get towed because I didn�t have a parking tag on the dash.....when I wasn�t given anything by the front desk. I go talk to the front desk after our morning at the park & they say that they do charge for handicap and end up giving me a parking tag. Overall, it was not worth even the small cost of the stay. If staying at this property for Disney benefits- I suggest looking into a Disney Value resort. The inside of the hotel room just in general felt damp. Comforters on the beds were both damp. Friendliness of the staff was much less than acceptable, and I did not enjoy getting wrong information and a threat to tow my vehicle when it was their mistake.

With the exception of valet parking for $25 per night, there is no other parking on this property.

"The picture on Expedia was misleading to actual property. The photo of the lobby was accurate, however. The location is great and the grounds are well kept. The actual room was a bit different. The bathroom was extremely small with little room to move let alone fit two guests. The bathtub was cracked/peeling off in one corner and there were stains on the tub floor. Also, there was no mirror in the room aside from the mirror in the bathroom which wasn't conductive to two guests. We most likely won't be staying at this location again.

"Family and I stayed here for three nights. Really nice hotel close to Disneyland. The staff was super friendly and always had a smile for you. The room was nicely updated and quite- except for the air conditioning unit. That thing rattled on and off throughout the night. But we were so exhausted from being in the parks all day that it didn�t wake us after the first night. Walking to the parks took about 10 minuets. The room was spacious and didn�t feel cramped with four people moving around. The bathroom was nice and clean with decent counter space. Shower was big and had enough room to move without touching the sides. Could use more places to put your stuff on though. Very small corner shelf so had things on the shower floor. 
 First time staying here but won�t be our last.

 The pools were not crowded because there were so many too choose from! The restaurants were great as well. Thank goodness for the little coffee shop downstairs that was open early and late.

 Only bummer was photos make everything look much more grand than it really is. The foyer is underwhelming in comparison to the photos on this site. The room looks spacious and wonderful in the photos, but in reality was very small. Given that it�s New York... the size isn�t really that shocking, but when you are expecting more from the photo, it�s a little blah?

"The property was great but we had issues with the day shift and not getting a room for over 5 hours. When we arrived the ""system just went down"", and no rooms were able to be given. I was told to write my name and phone number on a piece of computer paper and they would call when the system was back up. We checked our bags at the baggage counter and waited 1.5 hours before we got tired of waiting and went to the park. After 5 hours we returned from the park and the system was back up, no call or anything. I have a 7 and 5 yr old and we just flew from KC and they were dirty and tired.The day manager stated that he couldn't comp the room for the night because he didn't have authority to do so but gave us a free breakfast. He gave us a room key and when we got to the room and tried to go in there was someone already in the room, this was at 12:00am. I returned to the front desk and the night manager was there and he upgraded us to the tower, ok that's fine. We get to the 10th floor tried the key, it didn't work. So I had to drag my kids and wife back down to the lobby. This time he gave us a room key that worked but we still didn't know where bags were. The night manager was awesome. He ,for some reason, had the ""authority"" to comp us 2 nights and give us another free breakfast. The night manager was a great help and did everything he could to make sure he cleaned up the other managers mess. He even brought our bags to our room personally. He was the best part of the hotel.

"The pictures that appear when you book for this location are misleading. This was a dingy over priced motel that was not worth the money. I paid for the so called �upgraded room� and received a room with a balcony that overlooked horrible landscaping and a busy parking lot. I had to request for our room to be cleaned, the room itself was not very clean and some of the staff members were rude. I will def look for other resort options in the future.

"I stayed here with my girlfriend for her birthday. Prior to my stay I messaged the hotel about any additions for the birthday that if they added I would pay for in advance and appreciate. None of that happened. Upon check in the front desk woman was coarse and seemed overworked. I had questions about the amenities and she quickly averted the topic. The bartenders in the lobby were nice but it seemed that everyone was from another country(that�s all they talked about). That�s fine with me but it became noticably worse when they were arriving to work visibly hung over. 
 
 The �resort� is fine. At check in we were handed a map that let us know where everything was. There was a quiet pool On that map that we were looking forward to, however the reality is that it was unmonitored and often over run by kids and louder adults. The same with the hot tub. There is no spa here despite what is advertised. There is a small gym open to anyone and a sauna - and during our stay there were kids everywhere so we didn�t bother to use these features. Also - there are ducks on the property. For me and my girl we enjoyed them and know that in Florida wildlife comes with staying anywhere. However it was really disheartening to see kids and young adults violently chasing them away at times. It the hotel can staff some outdoor attendants to inform and assist with how the resort should run, our stay would have probably been a lot better

"I've stayed at the New Yorker several times and I am always pleased with my stay. There is a subway (A,C & E trains) station outside the hotel, as well as crosstown & uptown bus stops. The staff are always friendly and helpful. This trip I thought I had booked a double room but had actually book a single room with a double bed (it was definitely my error). While my friend that was with me is like a brother to me, I didn't fancy sleeping with him during our stay. However, the staff were able to find us a double room, much to my delight. I highly recommend this hotel as it is my hotel of choice when staying in New York.

"We were only comfortable 1 of the 7 nights we stayed in this hotel. I rented two rooms, both were changed day 3 due to cold showers the prior two nights. Then the hot water in the entire hotel went out and they lied for several hours before it was fixed instructing is to run the water for 15 minutes, just 2 more minutes...until I went to the desk and they finally said the repair had just begun. Another cold shower, and left in the morning. When we returned, the bed had water on it dripping from the air conditioner vent and the AC was not working correctly. Since it couldn�t be fixed, all furniture was moved to the side out of the drip area which meant I couldn�t sit on the bed without hitting my head on a light, and no AC for that evening. The next day they lied again saying it had been fixed. I had to call for them to move the furniture back and then looked up to see more water on the vent. We pushed the furniture over ourselves and slept like that the rest of our stay, without the AC working properly. After talking to every single manager and getting nowhere I had to wait two hours one morning day 6 to speak to the director of operations who all but accused me of lying because why would he �take a customers word over his employees?� He took 6 days off of one of my rooms. My second room that had been changed the same day as the first smelled like rotten eggs the entire time but maintenance did nothing and the director of operations wasn�t willing to do anything.

"The rooms are dated and definitely need an upgrade, but housekeeping always did a great job keeping it clean and providing toiletries and towels during my stay. I found it odd that the rooms didn't come with a coffee maker (not sure if this is a standard for all hotels or not) but there's a Starbucks and McDonald's across the street as well as a Dunkin' Donuts on the next block. The hotel's gym is pretty big and comes with a lot of treadmills and other equipment.
 
 The location is the best thing about this hotel as it's right across Penn Station, MSG and is a short walk away from Macy's and Empire State building.

"The Hotel location is ideal for first time visitors, Times Square, Empire State and Broadway are at a walking distance. Also, the subway is just around the corner. The rooms are very small but that�s understandable for New York, most hotels offer fairly small rooms. The only but will be that they charge you facilities fees for every night, that took me by surprise since I booked it through a third party company and was not aware of that.

"I did not like house keeping. They were rude and non- compliant with noise. One staff had music playing while she was cleaning and they were yelling to each other across the hall about non work related conversations.
 
 It was so loud we have to walk out and open the door to tell them we are trying to sleep. I was in disbelief that it was house keeping and not just other people at the property. 
 
 Then the other issue I had was we found a roach running around on the carpet and I took a photo of the roach and killed it. 
 
 The carpet of my room 156 looked dingy and worn down, I was very displeased with my stay to the point where the price was way to high for a Wyndham, or did Wyndham just hit an all time low. I truly felt like I was at a motel 6 or lower.

"They tried to defend a cost of parking that wasn�t posted off my receipt from your site but they pull it up on their page after checking in . So that extra 22$ a day is bull . If your going to do Business their shouldn�t be any hidden charges. Your site should be the same as their or Vice versa . Expedia had nothing to hide thank you. They must honor what is on paper if it�s written but they didn�t.

"This hotel is one of the best deals you can find to stay on the resort. However, don�t get fooled by the reception that is shared with the higher end Wyndham lake Buena Vista. The Wyndham Garden is dated, and let�s say not much love or attention is being put in.
 
 As soon as you check in, you�ll be dragged to a counter of someone who, by bribing you with restaurant coupons, will actually try to sell you membership to their Club. To access the �Sunset� part or the resort, take an elevator (that�s probably one of the slowest on the planet). It took us more than 4 minutes to get the elevator and go down one floor. If you don�t have have luggage.
 
 An old, dusty smell will great you in a yellowish setting that is your room. And probably your neighbors will greet you too because the walls are so thin. The room is however very clean and the bed is comfortable. There is a serious lack of power plug near the bed. Thanks to an ingenious setup of MacBook and a lot of cables, we were able to charge 3 devices at night. 
 
 We grabbed a muffin at their �cafe�. It was probably from three days ago.
 
 The day of the checkout, if you�re not already up thanks to your neighbors alarm clock, expect to be waken up at 8:30am by staff knocking & asking you when you expect to be leaving. Please, don�t blame the staff � they�re just following management instructions.
 
 Checkout experience was a �You�re good to go� mumbling. No room for feedback there.
 
 Magical stay.

"After staying here several times during the past six years, this was likely our final stay. The location is excellent, it's about a five minute walk to Disney Springs. The pool is great and has a section that's wonderful for kids. The food at the pool, although a little pricey, is pretty good. Both the park shuttles and beds were great.
 
 However, the last two times we have stayed the housekeeping has been less than ideal. I gave them the benefit of the doubt last time and thought maybe we had the same housekeeper every time and they were just having some bad days but it happened this trip too. The tile floors were not cleaned during our stay and we had two people with long hair. The tub did not seem to get cleaned because a rusty stain started appearing from the dripping however I think they did try because two days when we came back for the evening, the tub was plugged and water was standing in it. We had the garden view on our other trips and this time we were stuck in the back by the employee parking. We missed the view but thought maybe it would be quieter since less people were walking past, etc. But the car alarms all night made up for it. The hotel room wasn't showing too much wear other than the tub definitely needed to be refinished as there were several peeling spots.
 
 I have recommended this hotel to many people due to our previous experiences however this trip was disappointing and for a small amount more, next time will stay on property.

"This is our third visit to this property, whereas I said I wouldn't come back due to the lack of shade and towels for the pool, we were only staying for one night and we were not going to use the pool. The property is great and the staff are always friendly and willing to help. We did make a tour of the grounds past the pool and noticed they still had not added any more umbrellas for shade. Will likely not stay here if we are visiting for more than 1 day unless the umbrella situation is resolved.

"Overall, it was a very nice resort. This trip was a surprise for my daughter's 17th birthday and I would like to give a special thanks to Deborah and Ali at Tesoro Cove who brought her out a cupcake and sang happy birthday to her ! She really loved it and nothing really phases her (not even the surprise trip) ! 
 .....I feel like there should have been a shuttle bus to Universal Studios from the resort as well as to Disney. The shuttle buses eliminate the costly expense of parking.
 .....I ordered room service two of the nights that we stayed and I was under the impression the charges were take from my account at the time the food was delivered but when I checked out, I was given the bill for room service and other charges. I was not given the option of having it debited from credit card and I would have preferred that to having more charges added to my already expensive bill.
 Maybe I misunderstood but I thought when I booked the trip through Expedia that everything except resort fees were paid for but when I checked in I was charged another $300 which was refunded but I was not prepared for that, I could have budgeted a little better for the trip.
  Nevertheless, it was taken care of. My next trip will be a planned a little better and I will stay somewhere a little less expensive and somewhere that provides transportation to more places. Considering we were out all day, I didn't need such a fancy resort. I still think the resort was beautiful and staff are very friendly.

"This is my second stay at the New Yorker and I will definitely be back! 
 I stay here when seeing a show at the Garden, and the location really can't be beat if that is why you are in town. 
 The A,C,E subway line is literally around the corner and if that doesn't suit your fancy, Penn Station is just a block up where you can catch any number of trains. 
 
 The staff are always friendly and willing to help. Lobby is perfectly airconditioned which is great on Summer days!
 Be aware if you want to check in early, they want 50 bucks to do so.
 Bed was comfy, and I didn't hear any noise from hallway/neighbors. 
 My room was 9th floor I think, and there was still considerable noise from the street. Nothing that ear plugs couldn't fix.
 
 The elevators, despite being numerous, notoriously run slow. 
 Rooms do not have fridge or microwaves.
 Those are really the only downsides. 
 Honestly, if you are coming from out of town to see a show at the Garden and the room rates are reasonable? STAY HERE
 You'll love it. 
 5 whole steps above Hotel Penn!!

"I liked that it wasn�t a tall building, meaning that there were only two story buildings across the entire property. The rooms seemed a little outdated, we stayed in an outside room (our door didn�t exit to an interior corridor) and our room never got cold, we had the ac running constantly. But the room was great because we brought our dog along and it was very easy to walk her with the exterior room. Also, our bathroom fan didn�t work which was strange. So besides the AC, the bathroom fan, and the semi out of date rooms, the hotel is nice! No signs in the lobby tho for check in etc, the pool was great, the gatorville restaurant was our go to for breakfast because everything was already prepared and not expensive at all. The fitness center was tiny! Not sufficient for a leg or back workout, and the WiFi in our room was horrible, not only that but sometimes our phone wouldn�t receive service either. Uber has no problem picking us up or dropping off. The hotel is also near a bunch of restaurants for convenience.

"Arrived at 11:30am last Saturday and was told check-in was at 4pm. (There was also a group of over 100 loud girls in the lobby so this was a tad annoying.) OK. At 3:55, we went to the front desk and the room was still not ready. First red flag. There was another family ahead of us who seemed to have the same issue and they arrived at noon. I went back in line after 4PM and again, room wasn't ready. It was at this point that I ""asked to speak to the manager"" 20 minute wait and no manger came out but the front desk all of a sudden had a room ready for us. We went to the room and wow, the madness continues. There were bugs in the room, the toilet wouldn't flush, the safe was not working and the hotel room looked like a dump. It didn't look like what I had reserved. I called front desk to speak to the manager and we switched our room to another one and was told that there were two buildings for the hotel and we were in the one I did not request. We were told we could switch to tower next day at no extra cost.The next day, we go to Epcot and come back to pick up our rooms keys. 9th floor in the tower. We fall asleep and not an hour later we keep hearing loud girls in the hall slamming doors, singing, and one point, music. It went on the whole night. Why were we placed on the 9th floor with the 100 girls. This area should have been blocked for them. Next day at breakfast, we were asked how our night was and we said it was terrible due to noise from the teens and even the STAFF knew

"The pools were amazing. What woukd have been better would be if one lazy river would be designated for adults only. There are rules but the staff does not enforce them so there really arent any rules. Kids jumping and diving in the pools and lazy river. Parents dont watch their kids.

"Location couldn�t be better. Very close to trains, walkable to Lower East side, Soho, Little Italy as well as In Chinatown. Great access to restaurants and shops. Really nice people working in the hotel, too. But the pullout sofa bed was terrible�our son ended up sleeping on the floor because he said it was better than the terrible mattress. Also, just one drawer in the closet, and it was odd to put clothes in desk and nightstands. There was room for a small dresser in the suite so this seemed like an oversight. But a mostly pleasant stay.

"Very disappointing stay. The property is clearly poorly managed by a Chinese. Manager and this is evident in every respect. Examples: when arrived my 2 beds room was not available since the property manager had �guests� in the hotel not registered that had taken my room (and another); I was given my key and when I eneterd my room it was occupied and this is how the unregistered guest were discovered .... I was changed into 2 room (disappointing as I was with my kids). The new room had dirty bedsheets, no toilet paper and door lock not functioning (not nice given that somebody maybe issued a key for an occupied roon as it happend to me). The next day when I returned to the room the room was not done.... I called and the reception required me to go down and get keys for another room.. I was extremely disappointed to be forced to change again the room.... but there was no way to stay in my room sunce they would not make it therefore me and my kids had to move to another room (this time 2 beds)... The new room had the phone not working. In summary a poorly managed property, a lot of staff is Chinese as well and speek little or broken English and keeps the property up to the chinese hoteleries standards.............

"Me and my boyfriend came to stay to attend a music concert, best time of our lives. Honestly, didnt get to experience the full service of the hotel since we were out and about and rarely in the room. The bed was big and comfy, but the decor and style seemed outdated. The only thing I would recommend is that there was no mini fridge or a microwave, just in case we had leftover food from outside or in there in-house restaurant. Other than that, it was a beautiful hotel and we would definitely come again

"This was a terrible experience to me.
 First of all I booked my one night stay at this hotel since it was showing competitive prices at the Expedia website, fool of me to pick it just for 10 bucks difference, at the end when I arrived at the hotel I had a terrible surprise to pay, as the lobby assistant told me, a mandatory 25 dollars charge for resort usage fee and 20 dollars for self parking fee. For 45 dollars more I would have gone a totally better hotel than this. The building is old, it is an open type facility like a motel kinda thing, see pictures of the hotel before you book, and the worst part, the walls are so thing that you can hear everything from room to room, I went to sleep at 2 am from the noise being made either at the next room or the room on top of me. I called many times to the lobby and asked them to do something about it, but they didn't. Terrible experience, over priced and couldn't sleep at all. If you are traveling with children, or you want to sleep at night or to avoid any hidden nasty fees forget about this hotel.

"This is the second time we've stayed at this property. We like the convenient location near I-Drive which is walkable. The one thing that we didn't care for on this visit was the lack of umbrellas at the pools. There were maybe 4 umbrellas total surrounding two pools. The first time we were here, there was an umbrella for ever four lounge chairs. This being summer and over 90 degrees on any given day, a little shade is necessary. It was so hot we couldn't stay at the pool for more than an hour as we had nowhere to retreat from the sun. Also, the pool towels were lacking as well. In two days we had to ask for the towels to be replenished and on Sunday the pool attendant said we would have to wait an hour for towels and that we should go back to our room and take our room towels to use that day. The lack of people at the pool would probably be an indication that the abscense of shade and towels was an issue for others as well. We come to Florida to spend time at the pool and to not be able to do what we love to do on vacation will certainly come into play when we schedule our next visit. Unless the umbrella situation changes, we will not stay here again.

My biggest complaint is that that is a �resort fee� of $35 you have to pay extra at check out and we were also charged $5 a bag for the concierge to hold our bags for a few hours. I have stayed in hotels all over the country, and world, and this was absolutely the first time I was ever charged for this service. I think it�s ridiculous. Would not stay here again.

Check out was easy as well, once more super nice staff. 
 
 We had stayed only one night and moved to another hotel on disney property for convenience. We realized we left a blanket at the hotel, capled back the next day to ask about getting it back. No one knew where it was so they said they would call us back. It took two days to find it but eventually they did after a few phone calls and were very pleasant about the whole thing. We unfortunately already left orlando so they are shipping it to us.

"The shower was so confusing with the 4 different knobs but once you figure it out its ok. You can�t tell which one is cold or hot because the water would perfectly warm and then you would get cold water all the sudden then hot, but it was ok for two nights. The cafe in the lobby could be better. My husband and I went up to get a cup of coffee and we just stood there. It was open. So we went across the st to Starbucks. The rooms are small, well ours was but that�s what you get in NYC. Especially since it was built in 1930 which is pretty cool!
 
 I loved how there is a gentlemen standing near the elevators and you have to show your room key so no one can wander the halls that isn�t staying at the hotel. Very very professional staff. Lobby very nice with a lot of seating to wait or rest. We were upgraded on our room. Right across the st from Madison Square Garden which is where we went. Overall, I would stay again for convenience, kind staff and nice rooms if you only have two people or 3 and the stay is 2-3 days. I don�t know it would have been ok. Wish they had a breakfast bar because the diner gets too busy. Thank you!

"The hotel location is central. However the service by staff at reception is really poor . They take their time to serve you n most of the time is short of staff n Super Long wait . When it rains , usually hotels provide umbrellas free of charge for hotel guest but this hotel charges US$25 as a deposit . We stayed at this hotel for 6nights n decided to join a 2day one night tour to Boston over the weekend n recheck into hotel again on Sunday for one more night before moving off to atlanta . We hv to leave our luggages with the concierge n the hotel charged us $10 per bag for depositing over the weekend . This is the first time I stayed at a hotel where keeping the bags aside has a charge.That really shock us . When we asked for a receipt, was told that they only accept cash n no receipt will be issued . 
 This will be the last they see us & I strongly do not recommend anyone who is on holiday to stay in this hotel . Confirm your happy holiday will be ruined.

"As an Australian family with two children (5&7yrs) on holiday in the US, visiting Disneyland & California Adventure Park for four days, we loved staying at Wyndham Garden Hotel. See our positive comments below:
 
 The hotel was close enough for a 7-8 minute direct walk to the outer security point of the parks, we visited either once or twice a day (with a break in afternoon), we did not feel unsafe and even after the 9pm World of Light show or 9:30pm fireworks, there were still lots of people/families walking back along with us
 
 The staff at the hotel were genuinely friendly, helpful, the rooms were clean, our kids loved the two outdoor pools (luke warm & warm temperature which was great!) during our break from the parks in the mid-afternoon and we looooved the latte coffees from the cafe in the lobby area!! (A big plus for parents each morning!) 
 
 A huge plus were the surrounding businesses:
 - Two supermarkets/pharmacies with everything you�d want, 30 second walk 
 - Blaze Pizza across the road, with good sized wood fired pizzas with sauce, cheese and two toppings (we went Hawaiian) for $9.99 enough for an adult and our two kids only just finished one between them, awesome pizzas, crusts, staff were busy but happy, a really good relaxing dine in after a long flight/day in the park, went there twice in four nights
 - The Panda Chinese Restaurant in the row of shops adjacent to the hotel, 30 second walk, with really good (really large) Sweet & Sour Chicken, large fried ri

"The lobby is spacious and beautiful. The first room we were given was way too small. I requested a small ice box for my medication. When the staff tried to install the fridge, there was no room and no electrical plug. We tried to call the front desk, but they didn't answer. We went down to the lobby to request another room that would accommodate a small refridgerator. We were told that they were sold out and did not have any other rooms. So, I was forced to put my medication on ice, but that did not last all night. The next day, after 4:00pm, we were given another room that would accommodate a small fridge. Another problem with the room was the bathroom. It had a pedestal sink with a mirror above the sink and a 4 inch wide X 3 foot long glass shelf below it. There was nowhere to store any products. All toiletries had to be repacked daily. If you want a small fridge, coffee maker, etc. in your room, you have to pay a fee for each item. The security was very good, and the housekeeping staff were friendly and excellent.

No free breakfast but their cafe offered 2 for 5 breakfast sandwich deals which worked perfect for us. The room was very nice ,felt new.

We had issues with our keys and neighbors and the staff was so responsive and cordial everytime we had to reach out to them. Just beware that some of these promotional photos feature the lobby and rooms from the main building, but there's no guarantee that you WONT end up in the wings instead, with the slightly outdated units. They're still decent, but just manage your expectations until you actually get to the property. Plus, if you're just visiting and using your rooms to sleep, it's a great place to stay at

 You can feel safe, since there is a police station next door. The hotel is well maintained and there is a parking by a fee a few steps from the entrance. 
 I will strong recommend this hotel to everyone, and especially to a family of 6. We were six people and we fit great inside the room we booked. We didn�t have breakfast at hotel, so I cannot rate the breakfast/restaurant and the related service. There are so many places around to try for different breakfast/meals every day. So we didn�t have chance to eat at hotel restaurant.

The fuests stayi g were loud and shouting curse words outside of my window at all hours which, is not a fault of the hotel persay but things could be done to curb such behaviors.

At checkout, I complained to the person at the checkout desk who did not seem to care at all and basically blew me off and I asked to speak with the manager on duty. I showed him all the bites and he took pictures of my arms, legs, and neck. He took down my contact information and said he was going to check out the room and get back to me. He also looked at me like I was making this up!! That was Monday morning and it is now Thursday morning and I have not heard back from him. We have stayed at this hotel several times before because it is close to Disney Springs. In the future, I will look at other properties. Very disappointing and hard to believe I was treated this poorly. Nothing like ruining a Disney vacation with aggravating itching at the parks...

"We found the facilities offered by the Wyndham Bonnet Creek properties fantastic, from Lazy Rivers to Mini Golf to BBQ areas to Eateries. It was a great place to relax after a full on day at Disney World (just down the road) or Universal Parks (20min drive away). There are also a lot of planned activities around the complex but the Hotel dint really advise of any of this, we actually found out in the activities area of one of the other towers, im sure they would had advised us if we had asked at reception. A couple of downsides, laundry facilities, we stayed for 16 nights so needed to do some washing, the complex doesnt have a laundry so the only drop off service we could find was 20-25mins away, so all in all for drop off and pickup about 2hrs. House keeping also let the Hotel down, threee days in a row the kids bunk beds were not made up, couple of days where towels were not replaced, taken but not replaced, our daughters bed one night had not sheet, just a blanket. A lot of other small things but when you are paying a good amount of money you also expect them.

"We got zero sleep due to the thin walls. Walls so thin we could smell our neighbors cologne and perfume when they put it on. Our neighbors were not overly loud and obnoxious but the walls were so thin I hear the man burp! Awful and unfortunate. Beautiful lobby and pool, but when you can't get adequate sleep thise things become void. We normally stay at the B Resort when we come up, but decided to try this because of the pool for the kids. We wouldn't stay here again.

"So nothing was wrong with the property itself it was very luxurious and well kept. Cleanliness was also a plus. This staff however was very incompetent and rude. I couldn�t even pay a fee to check in early because the girl at the counter said she had to call a manager to see if any rooms are ready. Honestly I feel like she just didn�t want to deal with me or the 5 other people kept waiting because there was an elderly couple that checked in right before me & they got a room. Everyone else was forced to wait for 3pm. She didn�t call a manager. She was on her phone texting. And while she was checking in the elderly couple she answered her personal phone to chat. Talk about unprofessional! Same thing happened at check out. I only needed the room for a few hours to get some sleep so I didn�t even stay the whole night. I�m waiting at the counter for at least 5-10 minutes before someone assisted me now mind you there are 2 girls at the counter this time around and no line. I was the only one in the lobby! One was actually on the phone with a customer so she obviously couldn�t help me. Fine. The other one was texting on her phone & completely ignoring me! I was really unsatisfied with the staff. The one one that actually made me feel like a valued customer was the man that checked me in. Smiled when approached. Very attentive and checked me in a timely manner while explaining how to use the shower and about breakfast hours. You need to fire the 2 girls that are always on phone!

"This was our third time staying here. Our kids love the fact they have access to four pools, mini golf and other great activities. However, this time we had an issue with house cleaning. First day they woke us up early by continuously knocking until we opened the door. Second day they left tons of towels on the dressing table and third day our room wasn�t even made. The manager and front desk staff were excellent and genuinely apologized. The manager on duty personally attended to us until it was cleaned and even comped the resort fee for that day. Other than that, this property is excellent. Location, service, cleanliness, amenities are top notch.

"Hidden fees. Had to pay an extra $300 not mentioned when booking on Expedia. My card only had enough to pay for what Expedia totalled my room. I did not think I'd be charged an extra $300! Ridiculous. The girls working registration had no idea how to answer my questions about what the extra charges were for. I think her name was Monica. Anyway, I will not ever stay here again and I will steer anyone I know away from booking at Wyndham.

"When we checked in at around 2:00am in the morning, the clerk gave us the key to a room with 2 queen-sized beds instead of the one we booked via Expedia - 2 beds plus 1 bunker bed. As soon as I found out the discrepancy I rushed to the front desk. At first the man was very haughty and told me they did not have the room type we ordered and paid for, even without an apology for this situation. So I request for a partial refund, he refused and said that we had booked room via Expedia, we should ask for refund or compensation from Expedia not the Hotel directly. I was cross and continued to explain to this guy that the bunker bed was what we had promised to our daughter and now my daughter was so frustrated up there. Maybe due to my persistence, he at last told me that there was only and the last such room as I had booked. Since the guest hadn�t showed up yet, he agreed to change us to that room. And at 3:00 we finally moved to the room with a bunker. But the experience we had undergone was so unhappy. I should say this is a really costly hotel but with unsatisfying customer services in synch with its charges. I think I deserve an apology. So I won�t recommend it.

Why am I paying for this when so many hotels don�t charge? And why not include the fee in the price of the room rather than tack it on at the end? Strange business approach.

"We loved how close it was to Disney Springs. We walked there multiple times. The pool was ok, wish there would have been a little slide for the kids in the kid area of the pool. The room let in so much noise it was hard to sleep. We put the do not disturb sign out daily and we still had someone some in to our room while we were gone. Parking was good for most of the visit as long as you got back to the hotel early. Two nights we couldn�t find parking. I was upset because it�s something we had to pay extra for daily and I felt I should be able to park when having to pay. The front desk was helpful and said our daily parking fee could be used towards valet, so that made it a little easier to deal with not having a spot. Overall, it was a good deal and so nice to be able to walk to Disney springs.

"Bottom floor of hotel is the ""Garden"" section, in 2 different buildings. Seemed creepy for a single woman to walk to room, walkways were dimly lit, and no one around, I felt uncomfortable, and couldn't wait to get into room. Bed was comfy, but in bathroom although room size is large sink is tiny, shower great, no counter space for such a large bathroom. Bathroom ceilings are lower than bedroom area very strange. Front desk staff was efficient but not really very friendly. Confusing bus pickups for transport to theme parks, driver didn't speak English too well.

"I loved how I got an early check in with no extra charge, and Linda who checked me in was absolutely wonderful and was the highlight of my stay. I also love that the greeters open the doors for me. But I didn�t love anything else about the hotel. The room was small and dark and had no fan in the bathroom and there was a long hair on the back of the door and a smudge on the tub. No coffee?? Adolescent/college kids were super loud in the next room and the sound seemed to go right through the wall. Also hated how I had a $37 service fee for WiFi. I was aware I was going to be charged, but it�s false advertising the base price and just makes me distrust and hate the hotel from the get-go. I was glad to have a room in nyc for under $200 and the location was great. But I�m trying to forget this stay and would never recommend it.

"In my opinion, it�s unacceptable for a hotel to not have your room ready at the 4pm check in time. I arrived at 3:55pm, had plans for my family to shower after traveling there and then leave at 5:30pm to get to an engagement at 6pm. I had to complain at 4:45pm and then only did I get a room. 
 
 Secondly, I called at 8am to speak to the concierge and ticket agent about theme park discount tickets for the next day. I specifically said we would be there for one day and wanted to visit one park. I asked if there were discounts to purchasing through the ticket agent at the hotel and the agent said yes, up to 50% discount, but only after I checked in. I said ok and waited to purchase my tickets and thereby waited to select fast pass options. Upon arrrival to the hotel, I found out there was no discount for one day tickets AND with the agents �convenience fee�, tickets were MORE expensive than me purchasing them myself online. I�d appreciate honesty from my morning phone call instead of duplicity. 
 
 On a bright note, the room was clean. Because of the above two experiences, I would never stay there again. 4pm check in should mean 4pm check in, especially after spending roughly $200+ for a room for the night.

"The property carries the name Wyndham but honestly it is a refurbished hotel, maybe motel. The room that I had was way below standard for the price that I was charged. I went for a business trip and so it was fine, but if I were to have been with my wife, this would have been very disappointing. There was or is outside of the hotel grounds a homeless encampment and again, this company is using the name Wyndham as a ploy (in my opinion). I do not think that I would stay there again, sorry.

"First, room is very small and was not the same as the pictures AT ALL. There was no microwave or fridge in the room even though on Expedia it said there would be. Staff brought up a cart with a fridge and microwave and put it on the FLOOR. The AC does not work. The bathroom door is collapsing so there is a slit in the middle of it! And when it's open the door touches the bed! The vending machine stole my money. And when you call the lobby using the rooms phone no one answers. 
 HORRIBLE STAY!

"Nice hotel. However, there is music playing at the pool from 10 a.m. to after 10 p.m. The music can be heard throughout the property. It is extremely loud, and can tend to be a bit of a nuisance. The music isn�t a nice mix. Sometimes, you just want to relax at the pool, or while sitting outside. Not possible!

"The staff was limited and hard to find. The two working the front desk had poor customer service especially the bigger gentleman, he was down right rude. I was told they had a hot tub but it was out of order. I was also told there was continental breakfast yet the girl at the front desk just rudely point to the bar & grill in the parking lot. I went to the bar & grill and waited over 45 minutes to be seated and still was not told how the breakfast worked. They were very understaffed and had no (poor) customer service. When I was given a menu, I ask again how the continental breakfast worked and what was included. The man helping me just grabbed the menu and said �continental� and walked away. A little while later I received fruit which was surprisingly fresh and a hard pastry which looked and tasted a day old. My coffee cup was dirty and I was not acknowledged the rest of my visit.. not even a thank you etc on the way out.. (or on the way in) My room was fair. Bathroom was dirty, old and had rust stains from the bar in the shower... overall it was not a great place to stay. I will choose a different hotel next time I am in the area.

"Very pleased with our stay here while we went to Disneyland. The hotel is new with nice, clean rooms. The location is excellent - about 2-3 full blocks from the park (10 min walk). There are restaurants nearby and the bar in the lobby has deals for breakfast. It's also right across the street from a Walgreens and CVS. What really sets this hotel apart however is the Customer Service. Stacey and her staff really went out of the way to make us feel at home as well as helped resolve an important lost luggage issue with us after we had already left their hotel (our fault). We will definitely be staying here on future trips to Disneyland and I highly recommend this property.

"I liked that it was very close, within walking distance, to Disney Springs. We wished that there were more characters at the character breakfast. Also, the day that we arrived, we were able to eat at the breakfast, and they still did have a wide variety of choices, then the next time that we ate there, which was a little earlier, there weren't as many choices, and we feel that we didn't really get our money's worth that day. The busing to and from the parks was very helpful, although it would be nice if they had busing every 15 minutes instead of every 30 minutes before park openings and after closings because the buses were extremely overcrowded. 
 The rooms were clean, and the staff was very nice and helpful! We will definitely plan on staying here again! Hopefully the next time we come, the weather will be warmer and we can try out the really cool looking pool!!!

If you�re looking for a peaceful night sleep. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. Paper thin walls! You can hear people up and down the hallway. You can hear the room next door and downstairs.

Our room it looked clean but when we went into the bathroom the tub was dirty and then we took a shower the water won�t drain. We had to wait 15-20mins for the water to drain; once the water was completely drained the tub was disgusting! The walls are paper thing we could hear the people in the room next to us and also the loud music from the mangos night club across the street from our room. Staff was very nice and helpful but over all not the best experience at this hotel.

I would never stay anywhere else in New York again - this hotel is the one for me!

I was upset that i was not told this at check in, i had to take a cold shower to get ready to go out that night. Then the next morning we were woke up by housekeeping knocking at 8:30am and i didn't make it to the door fast enough she opens the door with her key and then asked when im checking out. I said 11.
 At check out i asked to be compensated for not having any hot water. I was told $28 back on my card. Very disappointed

"The rooms in this hotel are extremely small. Our room had a king sized bed and a pull out couch and supposedly slept 4, but there wasn't near enough storage space to unpack for 2, let alone 4. There isn't an actual closet in the room so we were only able to hang what we were wearing the next day and basically lived out of our suitcases. That said, the staff was friendly and efficient--true to Disney form. Although we didn't use the pool, it looked lovely. Disney Springs is an easy walk and a great place for both kids and adults--a huge bonus for this location.

"When I made the reservation it was for a DELUXE 2 bed room. What I got I believe was a handicap 2 bed room. The reason I say this is that the shower was made that you could roll in, no step up or down, the floor was sunken down so the water would drain. Also when I asked the woman as I was leaving if this was the DELUXE room she stated, Oh you made this reservation through a 3rd party, I said yes, then she stated well you got the 2 bed room. I don't believe this was a deluxe room. The wall paper was starting to come off in the bathroom, very small room. Not a happy camper. Thank You

"It is the first time an hotel really does the check in at 3 PM which is very late. After traveling i needed to rest for an important interview. Finally at 3 pm they gave me a key to a room which temperature was outside temperature (40s), I tried everything with the heat system for 30 minutes and ended up giving up. At the front desk, the lady started telling me I�d have to wait for the service guy about 30 minutes (on Sunday...). I told her I had an interview and really needed to relax. It is the first time she looked at me in all our encounters (hallelujah), and finally agreed to change my room... 
 The rooms are absolutely not soundproof. So after all that business I had my neighbors having sex and then yelling at each other�s. 
 The elevators buttons were so dirty, you were getting sick by just looking at them. 
 I will not go back to that hotel.

"I work at a hotel and I am a very chill and understanding person I stayed for two nights and it was just ""OK"" nothing special. The biggest stump to my trip was an ""Emergency Electricity Outage"" that I was never aware of. I was forced to stay out later or be in a room with no AC or light. Staff was above average it just there was too many things that were below my expectations. I hate to be the person to leave that bad review I just wasnt impressed nor did I have an amazing time.

"Just a few steps away from Disney Springs! Clean and spacious rooms easily accessible from lobby, pool, or parking areas. We encountered friendly staff everywhere and were pleased with the food options. Comfortable lobby area where we did have to wait for a while as we arrived an hour before check-in and did not want to leave our bags with the bellman for delivery to our room. The only complaint was we had to pay for self parking and the lot was always full so we had to utilize valet instead.

"I enjoyed my stay and would certainly stay again, and would recommend. I would just suggest more cleaning. The room (double bed) was small but comfortable. There were ants in the room. Closet space is very small. Pool is really nice, kids loved it. The food was delicious. We did the buffet breakfast everyday we were there, very good! The store in lobby is open 24hours which is convenient, especially when you have children and need snacks and milk. Staff is very friendly. Buses for parks come every half hours. It felt like we were staying in a Disney hotel, loved the colors, theme and character breakfast.

"Pool area was OK for my four-year-old they had a decent kid area.
 Overall I found the hotel unpleasant and surprisingly disappointing, especially for Wyndham. 
 Our room was more than outdated, but dirty. Anyone that travels and stays in hotels a lot... it had that depressing unclean feeling. I could�ve stayed somewhere much nicer for a lot less money. 
 Service was lacking- it took 40 minutes, and 3 phone calls for valet to deliver our bags to the room upon check in ( I should have self parked for the exact same cost and carried my bags). Had issues with check out, took forever. 
 I ordered two kids meals from room service and they were meh. 
 I�m not high maintenance and have realistic expectations. I wouldn�t stay here again.

"Although the property outside was beautiful and the pool amenities were great- the hotel room qhich we paid over 200 dollars for ONE night was dated. The tellevision only had basic channels, the room could have been cleaner. Upon checking in they hit you with a 24 dollar fee per day for ""maintaining"" the room amd property. I believe that should be included in the already expensive price of thr room. My 200 dollar room ended up now being 250 for one night stay which was less than 24 hours in the building.

"De locatie van het hotel was perfect! Dichtbij het Pennstation en timesquare ligt dichtbij en het Empire statebuilding. De kamers zijn wat gedateerd maar wel netjes en schoon. Wij hadden een geweldig uitzicht op de 37e verdieping. In het hotel zit Tick Tock diner maar dat vonden we wel duur, wel lekker en echt Amerikaans. Tegenover het hotel zit Mc Donalds en een pizzeria. En in de buurt zitten heel veel eettentjes waar je kan ontbijten. Enige minpuntje was toen wij de laatste dag de koffers weg lieten zetten omdat we �s avonds gingen vliegen en 12.00 uur moesten uitchecken dat we � 5 per koffer en tas moesten betalen en dat loopt aardig op als je met je gezin bent, zelfs voor een klein tasje moest je � 5 betalen.

"We did not like the bathroom window. As it was pieced together with screws. The top window was sinking down leaving 1 inch gap, making it cold and having to crank the heat. We kept the bathroom door closed to block the cold and sound to sleep comfortably, but then the bathroom felt like a country hick out house. You know out house as in a deep hole with a shack build over it out side in the cold. I know its Manhattan busy city but we were on the 26th floor and the window let alot of strert sounds bellow through..the rest of the hotel was nice. If not for the window we might return for another visit.

"Pro:I loved the 1920s vibe of the hotel, it made me feel like I stepped back in time. They had a small museum-like set up downstairs to look back at the history of the hotel, including items from Tesla. 
 The hotel was steps away from the subway and within walking distance/short subway ride away from the major NYC attractions. The staff were very helpful throughout my whole stay!

"The hotel offers a service to hold your bags after you check out - they charge a fee of $5 per bag. We were very disappointed with this service. When dropping bags in the morning there was a long line that moved very slowly - not ideal when you are hoping to get an early start on your day. When we returned in the afternoon to claim our bags, the service was even worse. We were second in line and waited for 20 minutes and they had not even retrieved the previous customers bags. We were frustrated since we were trying to make a train home, I spoke to a front desk clerk about the issue. Fortunately, he was able to get our bags quickly.
 My complaint is - if you are offering a service that customers are paying for, you should have appropriate staff to service that area in a timely and efficient way

"Fantastisk god beliggenhed t�t ved 5. Avenue. Time square og generelt i god g�afstand til mange attraktioner. Metroen g�r 100 meter fra hotellet. Der er udm�rket morgenmad uden at imponerer i forhold til dansk morgenmad standard Rigtig god kaffe. Der ligger flere morgenmads restauranter i g�afstand, men det er faktisk rarest at benytte sig af hotellets restaurant, da man g�r rigelig i forvejen til alt andet man �nsker at se. Personalet er super venlige, service mindede og im�dekommende. Vi boede i Premium lejlighed som er p�nt stor med 2 dobbelt senge. Men i det vi er 5 mennesker og der var en sofa som ikke var til opredning, m�tte vi sove 3 i en seng. Det gik lige for os selvom det var lidt tr�ls. 10 sal var fint. Ingen n�vnev�rdig gade st�j udover hvad der er normalt for en store by. Ligger op ad en police station, hvilket car uproblematisk. Stille gade af New York standard og alligevel s� t�t ved alt. Hotellet er hyggeligt og det fungerer efter hensigten. Der er en roof top bar som ser hyggelig ud n�r den er �ben. Vi var der i Februar. Fint motionscenter.

"Our stay here was generally a pleasant one. The king room we reserved was not available at check-in and we were given queen room for the first night, which, in addition to being much smaller, also had a broken closet door, leaking shower fixtures and a lingering smell of cigarette smoke, despite the property being advertised as smoke-free. Thankfully, when we spoke to Amalia at the front desk the next morning, she was very helpful and had us moved to the king room we had reserved. I very much appreciate her help and dedication to customer service.
 
 I cannot say the same for Orbitz. After speaking to two customer service reps, who offered me coupons for future stays but were not authorized to issue a refund, I spoke with a manager who explained there was nothing he could do, because Orbitz's terms of service permit them to give you a different, less expensive room than what you paid for, and there is nothing you can do about it. That right: I paid for a king room, they gave me a much smaller queen room, and then refused to refund the difference. The CSRs I spoke with at least tried to help; the manager clearly did not care whether I got what I paid the company for or not. I've been using Orbitz for over 10 years and have had mostly positive experiences, but they completely dropped the ball this time, and I'm not sure whether I will use them again. The measly amount of rewards I get compared to booking directly is not worth the hassle when something goes wrong.

"This is a motel is really a 1-2 star. It's very old and worn. I was very surprised that it's a Wyndham Garden and surprised that it was a motel (not a hotel). I felt mislead by Orbitz's rating of it. There is a free shuttle to the airport, which is about 10 minutes away. That's the best thing to say about it. 
 
 The negatives -- most of the hotel front desk staff were gruff and not very helpful. There's not free breakfast, which I would expect from this type of hotel. The room itself was old with peeling paint and cheap furniture. It is an old motel and there could be the potential for it to be really cool -- there's a little golf putting green and a pool -- but it's not be kept up or refurbished in a nice way. It feels like they're spending the least amount of money to keep it going! 
 
 I don't recommend staying here, especially for the price that they charge.

"So it was nice, and probably pretty fancy 10-15 years ago. But it's in need of serious renovations. The pool area was cool, but a little flooded inside the doors from the recent rain. Puddles everywhere. The hot tub was a slight green. Not sure why, could be the chemicals they use. But it was usable. Pool could definitely be warmer. The rooms are very cramped, the furniture they used is too big for the rooms. Unnecessary double desk you can't push in that takes up a ton of space. Bathrooms are super basic and old.

"Rooms are nice however my family and I along with 3 other families were stuck in the elevator to get to the pool for over 1 hour. Front desk receptionists seemed to not no how to handle the situation and we ended up call 911 ourselves. After the doors opened another guest came up to me and said she reported the elevator not working at 6am Saturday morning, so why was there not a sign or anyone working on the elevator to make sure it was working properly. The general manager did what she thought was best for the families, but it doesn't change the fact our kids are still scared and the panic attacks that they had. It was hot hard to breath and my 10 year old even got a nose bleed. We stayed in this hotel last year for a soccer tournament so we chose this one again this year for a tournament as well.

One evening, we came back to find the windows open to our room and a barely working heater, so it took several hours to warm back up. Other than that, everything was fine.

"My husband and I were very pleased with our stay at The New Yorker Jan 23-25 2019! Upon very early check in we were offered an upgrade for 2 queen beds with a large room layout for a small upgrade fee. The room was as described, very roomy and with 2 full baths a terrific plus! The bed was super comfy! I usually have a difficult time sleeping in places away from home and here...it was amazingly quiet and restful!
 The staff were accommodating, helpful and friendly and we would encourage anyone thinking about a stay here to make that reservation now!
 The best part were our meals at the 24 hour in-house restaurant, Tick Tock Diner! What an excellent addition to a great Hotel! The food was fast, hot and delicious and the waitstaff spectacular and friendly! Menu had great variety; feel good prices!
 Only disappointment....we did not get a chance to enjoy fine dining at Butcher and Banker...what a menu offering and the space is very elegant without being pretentious. Definitely next stay...as we will stay at The New Yorker every time we visit NYC!

The property is very convenient to Penn Station, with the Empire State building a handy compass point (it stands proudly a few blocks East), & the world famous Macy's (I don't even like big department stores, but I feel enriched by the visit). There's even an AMC movie theater across the street, & a Baskin Robbins open late. Make sure to go down the escalator to the little museum, telling the hotel's fascinating history.

"Property was nothing like Wyndham Hotels used to be. This one was about par with Motel 6 but perhaps not as nice. The room was a very utilitarian, generic ""motel"" room and not what one comes to expect at a hotel. The central A/C controls on the wall did not control the A/C despite the warning sticker on the controller. The room had an old fashion wall unit that sounded like a jet engine. The room was furnished with cheep particleboard covered with black veneer. Of course the room smelled a bit funky but that could have been the old air conditioning unit. 
 We were glad it was nothing more that a place to sleep at night.

Floor was dirty, shower was dirty, refrigerator didn't work and when replaced they left the non working unit in the room. There was damage on the wall above the window. Not what I expected from a wyndham property especially for the price paid. We stayed one night and it felt like we were not important to give a proper room so they gave is what was available. Not a 4 star experience more like a 2.5 or 3 and the price was not worth what we paid. Very disappointing stay.

 The downfall was not knowing the exact cost of the parking fee before arriving. I knew I was going to pay but wasn�t quite prepared to pay $22/night to park.

I had to call Lyft to be on time to the airport. They collect the $25 per day resort fee- and I could not ride the shutte bus because it runs sporadically.

"1) While we knew about them ahead of time resort fees are not appreciated. Most of all as they are considered ""Deceptive and unfair practices"" by the US Trade Commission as its basically a way to advertise cheaper prices then in our case double them. Anything with Official and Disney advertised as part of it should not allow this. Expedia should be more upfront about this, not small print.
 2) Hotel was clean and in good condition as was the pool.
 3) Counter staff forgot to authorize our parking pass and we almost got our car towed.
 4) They advertise two different rates for parking. One outside ($20) and another inside (counter staff told us $15). 
 5) We did not use valet parking but got charged tax on valet parking???
 6) Front desk failed to tell us about or give us the Extra Magic Hours pass we were entitled too. We heard about it through a 3rd party and had to ask for it with just two days left at the parks. 
 7) Rooms are not very noise proof.

 On arrival, the bed sheets were stained with blood and I reported it to the front desk and not even an apology in return. I needed it to call several times for them to clean the room and some days no show. So I ended up ordering towels that took forever to get on those days that room service was not done. To top it off I have to buy my own toiletries because they never refill it. I should be getting my money back this hotel was horrible. Enought that my husband and I ended up leaving earlier.

Floor trim boards are falling off, wall paper is coming off the wall, the vinyl on the chairs need be redone, carpets are are old.

Had to go to the front desk to ask for help with suitcases. Arrived to the room and no mini-fridge and none available. Terrible situation of trying to celebrate NYE, right?
 
 We made an organized pile of trash/bottles in the corner to be thrown, with a note asking to vacuum. Trash wasn�t thrown and no vacuum. 
 
 Water was questionably warm, two creamers provided, TV guide was confusing and wouldn�t give show names
 
 Room was clean, and staff friendly, but would expect more a Wyndham.

"My family and I were in Orlando visiting family and enjoying nearby attractions and theme parks. After a long day out and about, we were hoping to pull into an easily accessible parking space near our hotel room. Unfortunately this was not the case. Each evening we returned to the property, we had to double park the car and carry our sleeping children inside. After which we then had to come back out and look for parking a few buildings down and walk back to our room. Wyndham Orlando Resort should allocate at least one parking space per room, clearly labeled and conveniently located.
 
 During our stay, the cable also went out for at least 2-days. While the staff acknowledged the matter was being looked into and confirmed technicians were on-site, nothing additional was done. No one was able to provide an ETA for when the services would be restored nor did the staff offer other ways for our family to keep ourselves entertained while in our rooms (e.g. portable DVD player, board games, arts & crafts).
 
 Last but not least, the housekeeping staff failed to replenish our towels on two occasions. The first time we let it go, and made due with what we had. However, on the 2nd incident we had to reach out and ask for towels to be delivered to the room.
 
 While the property itself was in a prime location for our purposes, we unfortunately will not be returning.

"Amazing location but thats where it ends. The hotel is very tired and dated and in fact a bit grubby. Had booked a rollaway bed direct with the hotel and arrived at 11pm to be told there were none left. After haggling for an hour they managed to find one and it took a further hour for it to be brought to the room. On 3 seperate occasions the room keys did not work and had to be reactivated. Ate in the tick tock diner 3 times waiting staff were lovely but on 2 seperare occasions got our food wrong. 
 This is definitely not a 4 star hotel but more lije a 2 star plus. Would definitely not stay again or recommend it.

"We paid for a New Yorker view suite. At check in we were going to get a room on that floor but at the last second the room number changed from 4001 to 786. Upon arrival to the room we were given a suite, however our view was of a brick wall and another hotel window. I contacted guest services who said they would be able to waive a fee since they no longer had the room we paid for. They said they would be able to switch our room the following day after 12. After several conversations we were finally switched to the correct room. However we were not compensated for their mistake. We paid for the better room and should be credited.

I can tell you I'm never staying at one of those across the street MOTELS from Disney; they charge for parking and a ""resort fee"". Wyndham on the other hand has none of those charges and is a much nicer hotel for about the same room rate. We'll be staying here on our next visit to the parks.

"Liked the location of the property. Close to Universal Studios parks, which was our reason for going to Orlando. Noticed on the first night out door wouldn�t lock unless the door was slammed shut. We let the front desk know and they said they would address it. This was a major concern since we would be in the parks and outside of the room the majority of the day and we wanted to be sure the cleaning staff was aware of the issue. We arrived back to our room and the door was unlocked. Just a push of the door and anyone could easily enter the room. We let the front desk know again and the issue was never resolved. Thankfully no one took anything from our room, but this is a major issue for people who are traveling with valuables.

 The upholstered furniture was badly stained with brown smears, as was the carpet. 
 
 The wheels of the chair at the desk were jammed so the chair was difficult to move.
 
 We stayed two nights and the towels and washcloths that we left in the bath for replacement after the first night, were removed but not replaced.

"The pictures on Expedia are not a true representation of the property. The guest registration area is renovated and the staff is courteous. When you drive out to find the building where your room is located be prepared to haul your luggage up a flight of stairs as the property does not have elevators to the second floor. The rooms are smaller than they appear online, outdated and cleanliness is poor at best. The balcony was dirty and the sitting area was stained and moldy.

"The kids in room 2023 next to mine, were screaming and running all over our floor. The parents seemed to be doing little to stop these activities. At 10am this morning, with a �Do not disturb� sign on my door, I was awakened to the sounds of kids screaming at the top of their lungs running around outside on the landing and in their room. It is no wonder more restaurants are now kid restricted. Clean hotel, maintained ok, but terrible if you want some peace and quiet.

Kurz: Klein, dunkel, muffig, kalt. Wir waren entsetzt. Nach Reklamation (sehr nette Rezeptionistin) bekamen wir ein tolles Zimmer, gr��er, hell, warm und mit sch�nem Ausblick. Dewegen haben wir jetzt mit ""Sehr gut"" bewertet. Hotellage ist top und verkehrsg�nstig! F�r das Fr�hst�ck empfielt sich das Bistro "" 'Essen"" ca. 100m 8th Ave Richtung Uptown.

"This hotel is literally the closest to all the action in Disney springs. You just walk across the walking bridge and you�re there. Plus they offer a free shuttle to Disney parks. The price is awesome. The rooms are a bit small, but you CANNOT beat the price. There is a $25 resort fee and $20 all day in and out parking. Still the best price.

My great Disney vacation was ruined by the bad experiences in this hotel.

"The hotel is in a great location, literally across one bridge from Disney Springs and the foyer and main section of the hotel are beautifully decorated with great facilities, it's very welcoming! I was on a ground level room, and it does feel slightly 'motel' at first glance as the room was in a block and the car park was directly in front of it, however inside was a great standard, nicely furnished (a little dark of my own choice as I didn't want to open curtains onto the car park) and the shower was great. 
 
 Everyone I encountered working was friendly and happy to help, and the bus services to the parks were great and easily on par with the Disney service (which was one of my worries) as long as you don't mind visiting multiple parks on your way to the one you're going to (tip: if you want to go to Epcot, but missed that bus, get the Magic Kingdom one as it drops you at the monorail station for Epcot too, then get a bus to Disney Springs back later as you can walk from the stop to the hotel easily).
 
 For the price and location I was happy to overlook the room location, and if you're going to spend most of your time at the Parks you'll only really be there at night, so it's not as much of an issue as I first expected! I'd definitely consider staying again!

"The rooms were not worth the price. Very basic and a tiny bathroom with a flimsy sliding door. Lobby was pretty but had an awful smell from the bad air freshener that they use. Bus that they use to transport people to the park was playing a graphic movie which was inappropriate for young children. Also part of the bus collapsed on a woman�s head.
 Overpriced and certainly doesn�t call for a resort fee on top of the nightly fee.

"Initially enjoyed the experience. Problems appeared with the room late in the night as Inwas in the bar for a few hours prior and had only stopped to drop off my bags with my wife before heading down to enjoy martinis.
 
 When getting back upstairs I noticed it was pretty cold in the room. To correct this I turned on the heat a bit higher, as the night went on the room became colder, attempted to walk down to the lobby but saw it was empty for more than 5 min, went upstairs to figure it out on my own. Long story short, the room got to 58 degrees before someone allowed me to start the process of changing rooms around 2am. Originally the issue was that there wasn�t enough staff to help me, the person on the phone finally came up with enough complaining.
 
 I got to another room that was 78 degrees after being in a room that was almost 55 degrees. Once the staff member entered the room they were surprised it was in fact broken. My night and morning were spent dealing with this, preventing me from getting anything done, I ended up fighting the clock to get my work done before check out, when checking out, I tried to communicate my night to the staff member who was actively avoiding that convo as she never even asked how my night was. I ended. Up finishing my work in the lobby until my morning meeting.
 
 It�s a great hotel and the perfect location in relation to my clients. Also, rooms can�t all be perfect, just would have been nice for a much better communication and response.

"The location of this hotel was fabulous. Being right across the walk bridge to Disney Springs and then being able to use the Disney transportation options was The room wasn't anything to speak of (no pictures on the wall, very drab), but who stays in the room when you are in Disney? My only real complaint was check in. We arrived very early and I was certain the room would not be ready but the lady that checked us in said since check out was at 11:00 and we had arrived so early we would be the first to check in when a room was available. At 2:30 I checked back and was told we were second in line, but I had seen others checking in and receiving rooms. At 3:45 while standing in line again to see if a room was ready there were two other check ins, both with the same room I had reserved, and they were checked in immediately and given keys. When I explained this to the clerk, I immediately had a room. Of course, I was suppose to have received a phone call when the room was available (hours prior to this) and never received one. They need to improve the check in process if you ask me.

"Beautiful old style hotel, lovely decor, fabulous location, staff are lovely and friendly and very accommodating, we had a 2 double bed metro room, the beds were sooo comfy and we are fussy sleepers, house keeping do a good job, only quibble would be the bathroom , it was a bit worn, and in need of tlc, was inkeeping with the style but bath scratched and worn, tiles worn n grubby, bathroom tiny, knees touch the door if its open whilst on the loo... but not a problem really, just thought i�d mention it, concierge called Catherine was our favourite, she knew where everything was and what subway to go on to wherever you needed, and was super friendly too... we had emailed and asked for a view of the empire state building months in advance because it was to be our teenage daughters first time in America, and they didn�t disappoint, we had a spectacular view and also a view out the side of the hotel of Madison square gardens, would definitely stay again, the diner attached to the hotel Tik tok diner was ok too, friendly clean, and food not bad, perfct for a quick bite and ooen 24/7 too. The hotels christmas tree and general christmas decor is beautiful not OTT just lovely, they also have a little museum downstairs showing memorabilia and utensils, photos, posters etc from days of old at the New Yorker, well worth a look, a definate must stay from us, and would again.

"I liked the fountain out front and the wonderful lobby area. They couldn�t find the bellboy to help me and my 89 year old mother with luggage. The pool area was lovely. I truly had no idea the rooms are outside access. Guess that�s what Garden means? They put us on the parking lot side but when I asked for a change to poolside (interior, quieter courtyard) they were able (luckily) to accommodate us. Rooms are nice. Front blind and curtain configuration strange. I am a person who notices small things like chipped paint, not keeping up appearances, etc. and there was some of that. Would I stay again? No, just because I don�t like outside access, it might not concern someone else though.

"Central for everything you want to do in New York. For our first time there we are very pleased about our choice of hotel. Shower is a bit dodgy though. Reminds me of a burst leaking pipe! Room was immaculate. We were on the 21st floor which is slightly dated but with the level of cleanliness we and grumble. The plug sockets were not great. Whatever you have plugged in keeps falling out so you have to be really careful! We were faced with a hidden facility charge and as a good will gesture the bill was halved as the facility charge includes everything we had no intention of using i.e conference room, gym, room telephone etc and unfortunately it is a mandatory fee. I would stay in the hotel again.

 The New Yorker is located right near Penn station, making exploring the rest of Manhattan a breeze. 
 
 The room was quite small and a bit dated, but we didn�t go to NYC to spend a lot of time in our hotel room. It was clean and provided what was needed: a warm shower and a place to lay our heads after full days of walking and sightseeing. 
 
 The staff was friendly and accommodating.

I ask the police officer who made the complaint and they said that someone called them and that we were to loud and that they didn't want to have to come back to my room again
 
 I was in shock when they mentioned that I was making noise late at night and that someone made a complaint.
 
 I didn't quite understand why they had been summons to come to my room when I only checked in 1 hour ago and spent most of that time unpacking and preparing for my business meeting for the next day.
 
 I asked the office who lodged such a complaint and when they arrived at the door did they detect any load disturbing noise
 
 They replied that someone complained and that they don't want to have to come back.
 
 After I assured them that they would not be coming back to my room for any reason they left and I returned inside the room (1265)
 
 I didn't know what to think of the encounter so I called the front desk and ask if there had been a complaint about me or my room and was the night attendant, who checked me in,aware of any complaint made that required the police. He said that he did not know of any incident that require police intervention in particular to my room. I asked if he could look into this for me and get back to me before I checked out in the morning he said ok he would look into it. So far nothing

"This a beautiful property. Staff was friendly. The one thing that really stands out to me was the pet fee was $150 for the length of stay and we stayed one night. So we ended up with a bill of over $200 with extra pet fees and taxes ON TOP of our room reservation of about half of that. So for humans it was cheaper to stay in the hotel than a pet. Makes zero sense. Will not return with our pup.

"The hotel was nice. I was told the room was ""deluxe"" but I'm unsure what the difference was from the normal since our view was of the parking lot---which in reality we didn't mind since we weren't in there much. 
 Staff was great! Very friendly. Location was also great. It wasn't too far from the entrance. 
 What I didn't like was the smell that came from the sink. It smelled like backed up sewer. It was gross. But the shower was nice. The bathroom was spacey. Would stay here again.

 I like that there is a nice walking/running loop that goes around their man made lake. There is a small mini golf area. The pools are decent.. a few of them have small water slides and there is a small lazy river the kids enjoyed. Overall a good value.

"The property and facilities were outstanding as were the staff. What I disliked was the shuttle service to and from Disney parks, more specifically the timings. The buses to the parks went at various times in the morning and the earliest return was 3:15pm from a specific park. If you miss the return shuttle the next is on average 1.5 - 3 hrs later. You could use the Disney busses from park to park in order to catch a bus but that is my dislike spending hours on busses during my �magical stay�. Next time I will stay in Disney resorts.

"The staff was nice. John in information/guest services was super. He went the extra mile to always make sure we had what we needed. The history of the hotel makes it worthy of a stay. The art deco in the main lobby and the lobby itself is great. The rooms were the smallest I have ever had in NY. The water adjustment in the bath was impossible. Froze or scalded myself each bath. No amenities at all in the room. Plastic cups? Really. No coffee maker, no fridge. The Tick Tock restaurant on site was superb. Our floor (37) looked tired and old. Floor needs to be remodeled. Rooms are not accessible for most people. Too small and not sure they are even up to code.

 The rooms are very dated and small, not what we were expecting based on the photos or the price. When I raised that, the manager offered us some free wine which I thought was lovely. 
 They definitely need more elevators, we actually started dreading leaving the room because of the long wait for an elevator (and then get crammed into a super crowded one).

The second room was very tiny, barely room to walk and it had a terrible smell on the 22nd floor. The shower ran either scalding hot or freezing cold with no in between and yet we paid the exact same price for each room and they were so very different. I will say that the staff was very courteous and efficient, just the rooms were disappointing.

"From the outside and some yelp reviews we believed that this was a good hotel at reasonable rates. However, after making reservations and realizing that parking is an additional $25/night, the rooms are so poorly designed that two people cannot pass in front of the bed at the same time, the person who ends up in the bed next to the wall cannot even get into the bed from the side but rather has to crawl from the bottom. When we got there and two days after housekeeping cleaned the room, there was no soap for the shower, only a half roll of bathroom tissue, and no closet in the room. Also, there is a slab of marble jutting out where your head should be if you are planning on taking a bath. All this plus witnessing the argument while checking in between the desk clerk and an African American woman who was obviously not being treated right.
 There were several other major issues with this place and I will certainly NOT book another stay at any Wyndham hotel ever again!

Off made the room a furnace/unbeatable to sit in. Auto resulted in the air conditioner turning on and off all night. Everytime it turned on the sound jolted me awake. I got no sleep. A waste of money. Tried to get help from the front desk. They had no understanding and told me there was no solution. Very poor customer service.

 When we arrived the computers were down so we couldn�t check in. Returned 4 hours later and after a bit of a wait we eventually got our key. The beds are very comfy however in comparison to last years room it was much smaller this time. 
 They tried to charge a facilities fee which was fair enough however we did argue that the fee for the first day was a bit unfair given that we couldn�t get into our room never mind use any facilities. They did eventually agree not to charge us.

"Poor location. They indicated that parking is a problem on the street, but they had valet parking. When we returned to the hotel after a late dinner at 11:30, I was told that the garage was now closed and that I would have to find a spot on the street somewhere. After about 20 minutes, I finally found a spot three blocks away and had to walk back in the rain. You would think that a hotel where the front desk is staffed 24 hours a day would have their garage accessible the same hours. This is not a bakery or hardware store!.
 
 The breakfast was absolutely minimalist, no fresh fruits and the coffee was not drinkable. I would definitively not recommend this place.

"Hotel is in a great location for exploring the city, next to penn station & subway stops. Easily within walking distance to Times Square and lots of tourist spots. We were rather disappointed by our �welcome� by staff at check in time, lucky if we were spoken five words to by the particular member of staff we were served by whereas other guests checking in at same time couldn�t have been welcomed any more warmly by other staff members. But aside from this initial experience the rest of the hotel staff we had contact with during our stay were very friendly and helpful. Our metro room was ample in size with plenty storage space although room decor particularly bathroom could do with a bit of a revamp as felt tired and run down.

"Terrible stay, for one stayed last weekend had a clean and quiet room on second floor for a decent price. Stayed again this weekend price was nearly tripled and had a room not far from the lobby. Party going on in the banquet room so it was noisy. A lot of people in the halls being loud around midnight. Room was very dirty, hair all over sink and shower, carpets filthy, dusty rooms cob webs, tv remote didnt work, phone didnt work. Woke up to the smell of weed at 6 am. We just got up showered, and checked out. I have stayed here several times but this stay was not acceptable, wont be returning.

"Wyndham Garden San Jose Airport was offering a really good rate compared to the other hotels in the area for the dates that I wanted. I stayed in 2 different rooms during my trip to the area and that probably improved my opinion of this hotel. 
 
 I could tell that this was an older property that was probably bought by Wyndham and fixed up a bit. The lobby didn't give me the greatest first impression. The furniture and accent color decor were fine, but I didn't love the low ceiling covered in mirrors.
 
 I walked through the pool area to my courtyard-facing room. The pool area was spotless and the garden looked nice. 
 
 My first room (166) was next to the housekeeping office which had its own noise and traffic. The interior of the room had some nice updates like the sink, the bed, and decor, but the painting seemed poorly done. Perhaps this room only had 1 coat of wall paint; it clearly needed another several to hide the scuff marks and stains. The bed was very comfortable.
 
 My second room (190) was also courtyard facing. The wall painting in that room looked much better and it actually made the whole room as a whole look better. 
 
 The in-room Wolfgang Puck's coffee was horrible.
 
 I really appreciated the shuttle service. They were fast and the drivers were very courteous. Although the reservation information asked me to call ahead to schedule the shuttle, I was told to call back as soon as I was with my bag and ready for pickup.

"The good: Customer service was very good, friendly. The room was spacious, the rain shower was strong. In general, the hotel was clean and well kept. 
 
 The bad: Cleaning service was inconstant, would sometimes clean better than other times. The bed would be made up in to different ways. There was a small stain on the bottom of the blackout blind that I can only guess is dried blood. The shower glass also leaked and the water looks like is water damaging the corner of the bathroom. 
 
 Lastly, I do not recommend using the keurig coffee maker. Clearly, previous guests have used the hotel tap water to make coffee and it can be tasted. Furthermore, I�m pretty sure I got stomach bug from drink from it.

The bathroom fan, refrigerator and air unit all were noisy to the point where they woke us up. There was not a thermostat and the air unit knob just spun. So the room temperature was hard to regulate. Light from the hallway came in around the door thus showing that there was not a good seal on the door.

The nice lady at the desk this morning was very apologetic for his behavior. Unreal to be disrespected because he had to do his job.

 The one drawback is the absence of a safe in the room and not only in the room. There's no safe in the hotel at all. Nevertheless, I would return to this hotel.

"Check in was a mess. Waited in line for 45 minutes just to be told the computer was down, they would have to assign rooms by hand, and there were over 100 guest in front of me. The very curt front desk person then told me she would call me when my room was available. I checked my bag and went to dinner. No one called. Yes, the room was available when I arrived back at the hotel but the check bag person was no where to be seen. The guy waiting in front of me finally got mad and walked into the back and grabbed his bag him self. 
 
 This was a business trip for me so I ended up staying at the hotel for 5 days. Overall I found the bellhops friendly, though sometimes missing in action, and the front desk staff annoyed. The room was clean but the hotel was run down.

"The girl working at the desk called Stacy, is the most inconsiderate person I have ever met working at a hotel. The heating in my room was not working, and there was noise from the room above all night. I went downstairs to tell her at the desk and she said I have to wait until the manager gets in. I asked her what time is he in and she said 10am. I come back at 10am and I ask her if the manager is in. She then answers me but whilst looking at her colleague. I spend all day waiting for the manager and finally he says he will change my room and put a heater in there. I go out and come back to find that the new room has dirty bedding and my suitcase which they moved from the old room to the new one had been damaged. I would not recommend this hotel to my enemy.

When we arrived we were informed that our reservation was cancelled at 2pm and the hotel was booked. Which tells me they cancelled my reservation in order to charge someone else a higher rate then what i reserved it for 1 month prior to this date.

"Central location in New York, between two big railway stations, and in a very animated zone, this hotel could benefit more from a friendlier staff. Checking in and checking out too about 30 minutes each, not only because of too people at the desk (checking out) but also because of some interminable issues with the computer system (checking in). Otherwise, if you are OK with the (almost) permanent noise of syrens from police and fire trucks, and the crowd typical to this zone of New York, you would enjoy being close to almost everything in a veru circulated spot of the megacity. Our room was small and beds short, but this is perhaps we had a toom with a view (to Empire State Building). The other 2-bed room near ours, with no view, was apparently larger and more confortable. All together, this old (~ 90 years) and respectable hotel is what it is because of location. A nice surprise was the nearby Trattoria, a clean, quiet Italian cafe with direct access from the hotel.

"The rooms are so small that the walking inside them is very ackward. The walls are so thin that you can hear the conversations from the other rooms. But the worst thing was the indefference and the unfriendly attitude of the Front Desk and Housekeeping staff when I asked them for a missing bag of snacks (worth $ 25.00) that -I am assuming- the cleaning lady took it by mistake. They never apologized for that . To be honest, I don't care about the snacks, I care more about the good service and positive attitude. The Front Desk employees were acting like they were doing a favor to the guests, when is the other way around. They only said ""We are going to find out what happened, we will call you soon"". I am still waiting... at least for an apology. Do not go to this hotel, Central Park will be a better place to sleep.

The website said we needed to call in advance for the shuttle. She told me that I needed to check in 1st. Not pleasant at all. The shuttle drivers were prompt and very nice. Bartender very nice. Food so-so. I had a salad with Chicken that was so salty I had to send it back. It really is just a Motel to stay over to catch your plane. Would not go back.

"De ligging van het hotel is op zich goed. Vlakbij een metrostation en op loopafstand van Times Square. Maar dat is dan ook het enige positieve.
 Aan de negatieve kant staat dat het in een onaangename straat ligt. Het hotel zelf is zeer gedateerd. De kamer die wij hadden was klein, nee erg klein. Zelfs voor New Yorkse begrippen was de kamer erg klein. Nauwelijks bergruimte. Er was maar een kleine kledingkast. Die stond stijf tegen het bed aan, wel een stukje van de muur af, want anders kon je niet bij de lichtknopjes!. De deur van die kast en de deur van de badkamer konden ook niet tegelijk open. De airco maakte ontzettend veel lawaai. Die kon je dus ook 's-nachts niet aan hebben, waardoor het buitengewoon warm en benauwd was (de ramen konden ook niet open). De badkamer was net als de kamer een miniatuur-badkamer en bovendien beschimmeld. De wandjes waren ook zo dun dat je de buren zowat letterlijk kon verstaan. De algemene staat van het hotel was erg gedateerd. Het heeft op zijn minst een grondige opknapbeurt nodig, maar beter is een algehele renovatie. Al met al geen aanrader. Het is zeker geen vier-en-een-halve ster. Op zijn best twee sterren.

"Couple of front desk people don�t speak the best English. Still very efficient. Many of the rooms in this hotel are small and poorly laid out. This last stay, I had a king suite. It was like a normal hotel room in most other hotels. But at least it had room to get in and out of the bed.

"Building and room in dire need of maintenance. Aside from very thin walls, the acoustics for the room were horrid where you could hear the laundry room noise from 3 doors down as the housekeeping staff were washing linen and preparing their maids carts. Blinds on the windows were broken and wouldn't close properly. Electrical outlet on the desk was broken, threshold beneath the door provided too much of a gap where concern for insects entering room was prevalent. Calcium buildup on shower head was thick, so maybe a dip in CLR would help. Overall disappointed.

"We only stayed 1 night, but the air conditioner was not working correctly. The room was not very cool and extremely humid. Felt like we were staying in a musty basement. We could tell there were some nice upgrades to the room, (floor tiles, beautiful sink, and mirror, etc). But there were other areas that needed improving. (Bathtub had yellow stains, cabinets/shelves had heavy chipping, the hallway smelled like fresh paint, we could hear conversations and music through the walls very clearly) Also, I was not able to open the sliding glass door to the deck without the help of my husband. (The rollers were broken). So, overall it was an okay stay. I would find a different hotel to stay in the future though.

"My wife does not like elevators. So so we asked for the impossible, a room on the lower floor, with a view. The reception staff were very nice and explained that the lowest floors were given over to students and the hotel proper really stated on floor 20. 
 In the end, the large elevators were fine and although we were on floor 22. We did have a room with a view over the Hudson.
 The Hotel is historic 1930, perhaps not as huge as it was in the 1930's when it had over 2000 rooms but it retains many of the decorative features and style. It's been refurbished a few times. It does show signs of its age, but that is the character.
 Brown paint, deco carpets, a little shabby but that is nicer than some corporate slick hotel. (Yes noisy plumbing, the shower pressure is excellent but it does have a downside if someone next door showers late at night).
 The rooms are modest, some quite small I gather.
 Comfort was good, a nice bed, good linen, sheets changed every day. Housekeeping excellent.
 Noisy air con but it worked. Great shower/bath. 
 So a recommended hotel. With excellent service.

"Booked a courtyard room with two queen beds, ended up with a room towards the street with two twin beds. The light from the outside made it feel like day time in the room even with the curtains and blinds closed. I could hear the neighbors talking outside all the time. At 2am, people were coming home from the bars and were crazy loud. I even wear ear plugs and could tell you their whole conversation. I stepped out to ask them to move away from my room since we had an early flight. Thankfully they were not confrontational. The air conditioner sounded like a plane taking off everyone it kicked on. I wouldn�t recommended staying here if you actually need to catch sleep.

"I chose this hotel as I had previously stayed there on my last visit over a decade ago and it was exactly as I remembered it. The location is ideal for city sightseeing as its on the corner of 34th and 8th only a block down from Times Square and 3 from the Empire State Building. Penn Station is only about 2 minutes walk from the hotel giving easy access to the subway and train network. The hotel itself is very comfortable its by no means the most up to date hotel but everything was clean it all worked and I was very happy to have this as my base for my 4 night stay, it was also quiet enough for me to be able to sleep and recover from a hard days sightseeing. The staff were all friendly and professional and I have to say if I was to go back I would have no problem staying here again.

Room was not the most comfortable - hard wood floors felt grimy, AC was almost unbearably loud (we had to sleep without it) and walls are thin. The upside is that the hotel staff were very polite and accommodating and tried to help us resolve the issues. Overall a good choice if you need a basic hotel in the middle of Manhattan.

If you're looking for peace and quiet with access to some decent food choices and located not far from Citi Field, US Open or just family and friends in Queens - this is the right place for you. It's a mostly no frills hotel. It's clean and quiet and has a decent bed. Access in the direct walking area to food 24 hours a day. I would definitely stay here again.

"The entrance & lobby seemed nice. 
 After entrring our two rooms, we immediately saw the drips, dust, hair, damage on all our internal doors & bathroom. At 10:30pm a loud party with music blaring, started in the room connected to us. They were letting at least a dozen guys slip into the exit door for this party. We went to the desk to complain, we came back to being locked out of one of our rooms & no one doing anything to stop the party. Five trips to the front desk in our pj�s (walking around a big spill that no one would clean up) cound not get the door lock to work. It�s now 11:30pm. Party still raging and us huddled with the person who is locked out of their room. A security guy came to help. He was unable and we had to wait 20min for someone to drive to the hotel with their master key to re-set the lock. After I ask security why no one has stopped the party, he pounds on the door. The party raged on till past midnight and we were relocated. We never saw the party get stopped. The next day we were locked out of one of the new rooms and informed we were given the wrong keys. They swapped our room keys so each group stayed in rooms, that were in the names of the other. My sister needed to check out a day before me so, it was a long process to get it straightened out. It made us miss a family breakfast before family left and I returned to my room to be locked out AGAIN. We did not finish our stay. Horrible experience.

"All in all a very pleasant stay in this iconic hotel, however a couple of things let it down. Firstly the lack of a thermostatic shower with just hold/cold taps to try and get the balance right meant showers took longer than necessary and left you at the mercy of other people�s water usage. Second the lack of coffee making facilities was another disappointment in what was otherwise a pleasant stay. Also read the booking small print, as there is a $29 PER NIGHT service charge added in, which I wasn�t prepared for at check out.

"Dirty, old rooms. Hotel has made some floors into dorms so the elevators are a nightmare. Windows offer no protection against the noise from outside. Sirens all night. Was told I would get a call for early check in; they forgot and I sat in the lobby desperately needing sleep while others happily went up to their room. Overall not impressed. If u don�t care about cleanliness, it�s in a nice location. I will not be returning to this dump.

"My wife left something in the refrigerator and realized it right after we checked out. No one seemed to be able to help her to get it back and then she got stuck in the elevator. She pushed the call button repeatedly and no one was coming. Finally, she got it to go up a floor and she was able to get out. When she told the staff member at the front desk they seemed unconcerned about it. 
 
 The hotel bed was comfortable enough, but the whole place smelled like various cleaning solutions...and yet it wasn�t very clean.

The staff was welcoming and efficient in checking us in late, and always made us feel at home when we entered or exited the lobby. The pool is fine, but you won't use it much. The free parking in the garage was a bonus for us and the location near Disneyland and convenient stores like Walgreens and CVS was excellent. Rooms were large and clean. We would consider staying here again in the future.

"This resort is broken up into 2 parts. The Wyndham Grand which is the Hotel and the resort which is the Timeshare part where the full suites are. You have access to all of the of the full resort however when it comes to room charges you can only do your room charges on the hotel side. I made that mistake one day during my stay and went to one of the pool bars on the other side of the resort on the timeshare side and tried to charge the drink to my room and they could not find my room number . I had to go back later to bring my payment later in the day. The staff goes out of your way to be kind and helpful and they gave me an upgrade at no charge since it was my birthday and also a late checkout on the day I was checking out as well. It was a very enjoyable stay on the whole. I would recommend to anyone who has a family or just a couple who wants a romantic weekend away. Lovely hotel.

The only restaurant food was acceptable. The concierge desk was not helpful at all. The shuttle service required advance notice and costed more than the Lyft option we used.

The rooms are clean, quiet and the bed is very comfortable. The business center and fitness center are extremely accommodating. Easy walks to food venues, times square and cabs are attainable with a doorman to assist. All in all, even though this is one of the oldest hotels in town, it is a great place to stay.

"The deluxe king room looked fairly small than what it is advertised on the Expedia website. I spoke to the front desk and they informed me that this was indeed the king room and the bed looked like a queen. The room was well kept and clean. The vending machines were broken and there was only water available at the time. There isn't much parking around the area and if you choose valet it is an additional $25.00.

"Met a woman that was checking into The WYNDHAM NEW YORKER foR the first time I assured her her checking experience would be great , after hearing her last 2 1/2 hour check in experience at another hotel inthe same vicinity. Checking in at about 5:30 to 6:00 after a very long day we walked into 3 receptionists at the counter 4 people on line ,another staff member took myself to another desk and we both were checked in within 3 -5 minutes!! She was amazed & so grateful for their professionalism, and said from now on I will always book the New Yorker !! She also said I cannot believe I have put up with such poor service for 6 years from the other hotel!!! Thank you WYNDHAM NEW YORKER !!

"This hotel is well kept and the staff are courteous and professional. The location is great because you have a shopping area and movies right behind in walking distance. It is also a nice area that feels safe in Queens. I only wish parking was an amenity to the hotel because parking is difficult and if you use their parking its $25.00 a day.

"PROS - Very friendly and helpful check-in, Great resort layout with a lot of walking areas in a park-like setting, beds were comfy, tons of restaurants and stores in walking distance, having 2 pools was nice.
 
 CONS - Service at Gatorville is mediocre at best, ""Pool bar"" is enclosed now which defeats the purpose of a pool bar, Pool itself is pretty dirty and we never saw anyone tending to it, had to go search for pool towels each of the 3 days we were there, Bathrooms in the Premium rooms are tiny, Kid's Playground has been ""closed for repairs"" for 2 years now!
 
 Overall, we were a little disappointed. Having stayed here many times before, there were a lot of little things that have slipped through the cracks. Garbage cans were full, no towels, didn't see any workers walking through the grounds cleaning up the whole time we were there. We stay here for the location.

"This is not a good neighborhood. There was nearby police activity on my first night. I was told by a friend not to venture out, so I didn't. The place is a MOTEL, not a hotel. The rooms are located outside and you can see whenever someone walks by (under the door and at the window). The bathroom was old and dingy. I felt like I needed shower shoes.

"Convenient location for JFK; friendly staff; free street parking if a spot available (c/w $25 valet); reasonable food and drink options available within walking distance (mostly chains). Rooms ok - no carpeting, which is a positive for those with allergies, etc. Main issue was the SMELL! The first room I was given reeked of stale cooking oil (there is a kitchenette with a cook top; clearly well used). Smoke/CO2 alarm also going off, so I asked for a different room. Second one - no alarm beeping, but same stale cooking smell. Stuck with this one, but woke with the stench in my nostrils. Not pleasant. Also a call-out to the mystery shower. I have stayed in many hotels around the world, but I just could not work out how to use it. Took a nice bath instead, but not really the point.

Upon arriving to my room, my bed was not made. Also, as I was attempting to fall asleep, the cleaning staff were extremely loud as they were cleaning rooms, so I had to kindly go out of my room to ask them to keep it down, to which they laughed and continued being loud. My flight had been cancelled and I had dealt with a lot of annoying travel issues, I simply wanted to come to a hotel and relax, feel welcomed and safe, that wasn�t my experience. Every phone call I made to the front desk to ask for help with the room, or the cleaning staff, was never answered. I actually had to call from my cell phone to the front desk to have someone answer.

The hotel is within walking distance from Disneyland which made it super accessible after a late night/long day of fun. There�s tons of restaurants around it. Easy access to the underground parking garage. Friendly and helpful staff. (They even gave us a late check out, which we greatly needed.) But my absolute favorite thing about it was the bed. We had a king size bed that you just sunk into. Probably one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. I wish I could have taken that bed home with me.
 
 They were doing some work to the entry way when we arrived but the sound didn�t bother us as our room was facing the opposite side. My only complaint was that the hand held shower attachment leaked and didn�t work. Other than that, our stay was amazing.
